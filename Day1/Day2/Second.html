            <h2>Skills & Abilities</h2>
            <p><b>MANAGEMENT</b></p>
            <p><li>I will use my management skills when one of my employees is constantly coming late and 
                not meeting deadlines. So I will 
                sit down with him and talk about the situation. 
                Then, I will explain how his lateness affects the team and suggest how he could improve. After that, I’m sure he will start coming in on time and meet his deadlines.</li></p>
            <p>Duration: January 2019 - Present</p>
            <p><b>HARDWORKING</b></p>
            <P><li>If my employee works hard, I will give him positive feedback. But if somehow he is lacking somewhere, I will ask him why he is lacking with that. Also, I’ll give him feedback that boosts his morale but not discourage him.”</li></P>
            <p><b>PATIENCE</b></p>
            <p><li>“I will deal with conflict within the team when my two employees are constantly arguing with each other. I will sit down with both of them and talk about the situation. I will explain how their fight affects the rest of the team and suggest how they could resolve their differences. After that, I’m pretty sure they will stop arguing.”</li></p>
            <p><b>COMMUNICATION</b></p>
            <P><li>“I think the most important quality for a successful manager is communication. A good manager needs to be able to communicate clearly with their team and provide them with the information they need to do their jobs well. Without clear communication, it’s easy for things to get lost in translation and for problems to arise.”</li></P>
